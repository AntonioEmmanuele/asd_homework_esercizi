    There are N students standing in a row and numbered 1 through N from left to right.
    You are given a string S with length N, where for each valid i, the i-th character of S is 'x' 
    if the i-th student is a girl or 'y'
    if this student is a boy. Students standing next to each other in the row are friends.

    The students are asked to form pairs for a dance competition. 
    Each pair must consist of a boy and a girl. Two students can only form a pair if they are friends.
    Each student can only be part of at most one pair. What is the maximum number of pairs that can
    be formed?
